Live Tennis Rankings

Tennis rankings are based on a 52-week point system. Each week a tournament is played, players have the opportunity to earn points with every match they play. The goal of this program is to see how tennis rankings can change after each single match, not just from week to week. Data on each player is pulled from the rankings website, and data on each of the tournament draws is pulled from flashscore.com/tennis.

At this point I have almost completed "Race to Shenzhen" rankings. This rankings system is made to see who the best performers are in a calendar year, rather than in a 52-week cycle.
