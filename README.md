Tracking how tennis rankings change after each match is played.
Normally men's and women's tennis rankings are updated after an entire tournament is completed (which is usually every week). Tennis rankings are calculated on a points-based system, and since the rules are available online (and I'm a huge tennis fan), it's possible to calculate tentative rankings after each match is played.
